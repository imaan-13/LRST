\title{Theoretical Relative Treatment Effect Size Under Gaussianity Assumption}
\usage{
theta.bar.theo(xm, ym, xs, n.iter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{xm}{Placebo Mean}

\item{ym}{Treatment Mean}

\item{xs}{Placebo Standard Deviation}

\item{n.iter}{Number of iterations}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar giving the theoretical relative treatment effect size
\eqn{\bar{\theta}} under Gaussianity assumption.
}
\description{
Calculates the theoretical relative treatment effect size \eqn{\bar{\theta}} under Gaussianity assumption.
This is the expected difference in ranks between treatment and placebo across all outcomes and time points.
